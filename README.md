## File Structure

This repository contains the following file structure:

ðŸ“‚ data
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ alignments
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ s1
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ s1
ðŸ“‚ models
ðŸ“„ LipNet_2d.ipynb
ðŸ“„ LipNet_3d_bilstm.ipynb
ðŸ“„ LipNet_3d_gru.ipynb
ðŸ“„ Lip Reading AI.pdf

ðŸ“‚ data/alignments/s1 contains the ground truth labels for each .mpg file.

ðŸ“‚ models contains the saved weights for each model respectively

ðŸ“„ LipNet_2d.ipynb, ðŸ“„ LipNet_3d_bilstm.ipynb, ðŸ“„ LipNet_3d_gru.ipynb are the respective models outlined in the ðŸ“„ Lip Reading AI.pdf which is the final report.

## Code Instructions

Within each .ipynb is the code required to train and evaluate the model. If you would like to use the saved weights instead of training the model, please execute all cells except for the following cell:

> model.fit(train, validation_data=test, epochs=100, callbacks=[checkpoint_callback, schedule_callback, example_callback])
model.save('models/3dcheckpoint.weights.h5')
